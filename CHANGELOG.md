## 2.3.1
- **Fix:** Improved the `amortiseInterest` function to better handle interest accrual when additional advances occur in a repayment schedule. Previously, interest accrued between the last payment and an advance wasn't tracked, since advances didnâ€™t account for it. Now, this interest is properly assigned to the first payment that follows the advance.

## 2.3.0
- **Feature:**
  - Consolidated the **UK CONC App 1.1** and **UK CONC App 1.2** day count conventions into a unified `UKConcApp` class, preserving the distinct FCA-defined time computation rules for consumer credit agreements secured on land (App 1.1) and not secured on land (App 1.2). Added an `isSecuredOnLand` parameter to toggle between mortgage and non-mortgage logic, maintaining the single payment edge case (CONC App 1.1.10 R (4)) for secured agreements while simplifying maintenance and reducing code duplication.

## 2.2.0
- **Feature:** 
  - Implemented the **UK CONC App 1.1** day count convention for computing the Annual Percentage Rate of Charge (APRC) for consumer credit agreements **secured on land**.
  - Implemented the **UK CONC App 1.2** day count convention for computing the APRC for consumer credit agreements **not secured on land**.

## 2.1.4
- **Documentation:** Updated EU200848EC Day Count Convention dart doc and README to clarify that, despite the European Union Directive 2008/48/EC being repealed and replaced by Directive (EU) 2023/2225, the day count implementation remains unchanged.

## 2.1.3
- **Fix:** Updated the EU200848EC computeFactor day count method to ensure that when both the initial drawdown and subsequent cash flow dates fall on the last day of their respective months, the period is calculated in whole months or years. Previously, this method correctly handled months with 30 or 31 days but failed for February 28th or 29th, where periods were incorrectly counted in days.

## 2.1.1
- **Modified:** Changed the DayCountFactor toString() and toFoldedString() methods to support compact rendering of long operand chains generated by some day count conventions, ensuring the integrity of displayed formulae is maintained.

## 2.1.0
- **Switched:** Replaced the Enhanced Newton-Raphson method with the Standard Newton-Raphson method to expand the solution space/window (the trade-off being a slightly slower convergence speed).
- **Added:** Implemented the Actual/360 day count convention
- **Added:** Implemented the 30U/360 day count convention, similar to 30/360, except February 28th (non leap-year) and 29th (leap-year) are treated as a 30-day month
- **Opened:** Adjusted the calculation precision constraint to allow input in the range 0 to 4 decimal digits
- **Code:** Performed housekeeping and clean-up

## 2.0.0
- **Updated:** Changed Dart SDK version constraint to 3.0.0 +
- **Updated:** Refreshed build package dependencies
- **Performed:** Minor code housekeeping

## 1.1.1
- **Added:** Included UnsolvableException export to library barrel file
- **Corrected:** Fixed README examples and results

## 1.1.0
- **Converted:** Transformed calculator computational methods to asynchronous functions
- **Added:** Introduced checked UnsolvableException for unsolvable values
- **Updated:** Revised examples

## 1.0.0
- **Initial:** Released initial version.
