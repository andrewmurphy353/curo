## 2.1.3
- Fix: Updated the EU200848EC computeFactor day count method to ensure that when both the initial drawdown and subsequent cash flow dates fall on the last day of their respective months, the period is calculated in whole months or years. Previously, this method correctly handled months with 30 or 31 days but failed for February 28th or 29th, where periods were incorrectly counted in days.

## 2.1.1
- Modified the DayCountFactor toString() and toFoldedString() methods to support compact rendering of long operand chains generated by some day count conventions, ensuring the integrity of displayed formulae is maintained.

## 2.1.0
- Switched out the Enhanced Newton-Raphson method with the Standard Newton-Raphson method to expand the solution space/window (the trade-off being a slighty slower convergence speed).
- Added the Actual/360 day count convention
- Added the 30U/360 day count convention, similar to 30/360, except February 28th (non leap-year) and 29th (leap-year) are treated as a 30-day month
- Opened up the calculation precision constraint to allow input in the range 0 to 4 decimal digits
- Code housekeeping and clean-up

## 2.0.0
- Updated Dart SDK version constraint to 3.0.0 +
- Updated build package dependencies
- Performed minor code housekeeping
